# reSentral Flutter

A rewrite of my initial [reSentral React (+Cordova)](https://github.com/JumpyJacko/resentral-react-cordova) mobile app which aims to be faster and have more features due to writing with Flutter.

# About this Project
I honestly don't even know why. I've never coded with object-oriented programming and almost all of this code is from Flutter docs. This also runs off the same backend that the initial [reSentral React (+Cordova)](https://github.com/JumpyJacko/resentral-react-cordova) app so it's still slow.
